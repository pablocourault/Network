CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project 4 Network

Design a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

All Posts: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first. 

Profile Page: Clicking on a username should load that user’s profile page.

Following: The “Following” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they see all posts made by users that the current user follows. 

Pagination: On any page that displays posts, posts should only be displayed 10 on a page.

Edit Post: Users should be able to click an “Edit” button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post. 

“Like” and “Unlike”: Users should be able to click a button or link on any post to toggle whether or not they “like” that post.
